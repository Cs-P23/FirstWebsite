            Reason 2: You've Sacrificed for Me

        <p class="new">
            All my life you have continually laid down your preferences for mine and 
            I am wildly grateful. Where did we go out to eat in Myerstown?? Scarcely
            was it ever where you wanted to go, but where the kids wanted to go. You might 
            think that this is a small thing, but it's the small things that make up our lives
             and often demonstrate the most care. You have done a lot of other sacrifices 
             as well. You drove me all kinds of places when I was younger and tried 
             to get me invovled in stuff as a kid. There are so many other ways that you 
             sacrificed for me and it shows me a small picture of how Christ 
             sacrificed for us. 
             You are a great mom and someday I will be able to 
            sacrifice lots for you.
        </p>
