        <h1>Reason Number 1: I'm stubborn and you didn't kick me out</h>
        <p class='yel'>You put up with me when I was a cheeky little buttmunch.
            Seriously... I know I was difficult (and still am in some ways haha),
            but you dealt with me even though I'm chronically "always right."
            You raised me well... how do i know? The mark of a good parent is 
            if they tried pushing their kids to the Lord. You certainly have done so.
            You moved from the only life you ever knew at the GMC and uprooted your life 
            so that your kids could see the Lord. While it took a long time for some of us 
            to get serious about the Lord, we are serious about him now. Your 
            desire to put the Lord first is a marker and reminder for me to do the same 
            even when it is difficult and even when I fail. Thank you for being a great mom 
            and pushing me to Jesus.
            </p>
            <p>
            Thank you. </p>
